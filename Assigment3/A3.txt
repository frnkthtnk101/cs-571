Regular Expressions 
For this assignment you will supply egrep instructions with regular
expressions that return the requested matches.  You may test your
answers out on the input file bright_side_of_life .

For example, if I want to print all lines that contain the string
Spiros in the file bright_side_of_life, it would look like this:

    $ egrep 'Spiros' bright_side_of_life 

For each of the following questions, provide an egrep command that
returns the requested matches.

1) match all lines that contain the string the
	egrep the bright_side_of_life
2) match all lines that contain the word the (not as a substring of a
larger word)
	egrep -w the bright_side_of_life or
	egrep '\<the\>' bright_side_of_life 
Hint: grep uses \< and \> as word anchors (beginning and end,
respectively).

3) match all lines that contain the word Just
	egrep 'Just' bright_side_of_life 
4) match all lines that contain Just or just
	egrep '(J|j)ust' bright_side_of_life 
5) match all lines that start w/the word Just or just
	egrep '^(J|j)ust' bright_side_of_life 
6) match all lines that contain the word bad or mad
	egrep '(b|m)ad' bright_side_of_life  
7) match all lines that contain the word death or breath
	egrep '(br|d)eath' bright_side_of_life
8) match all lines that end with you.  Trailing punctuation is
acceptable (so, possibly followed by a period or a comma)
	egrep 'you\.|\,$' bright_side_of_life 
9) match lines that have leading whitespace
	egrep '^\ +' bright_side_of_life
10) match lines that are empty
	egrep  $'^\r\n$' bright_side_of_life 
11) How many empty lines are there?
	egrep '^$' bright_side_of_life  -c
