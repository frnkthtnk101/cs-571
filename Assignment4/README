 the safe way of deleting things.
DETAILS
++++++++++++++++++++++++
	saferm.sh
The Script grabs the file in the 1st paramter and its pos. Then it compresseses
the two things in the /.JUNK folder in your home directory... due note that the
script will delete everything that has been past 2 days since it was put in the
junk folder only when saferm.sh is called. removal of old files is done after a
file is compressed.
	recover.sh
The Script decrompresses a zip folder in the /.JUNK folder that you selected....
the file will be put back to its orginal spot. Deletion of older files will happ
en when it saves a file.
